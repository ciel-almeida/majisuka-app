		image: gekikara,
		description: `Gekikara was feared by most of the Majisuka Jyogakuen students due to her sadistic nature and brutality while fighting. In the second season, it was shown that rumors about her had even spread to Majijo's rival school Yabakune. According to Team Hormone, she was fearsome because she fought for the violence rather than a victory. When losing her self-control while fighting, Gekikara could go as far as attempting to kill her opponent.`,

		age: 15,
		fullName: 'Nezumi',
		image: nezumi,
		description: `Nezumi is shown to be quite manipulative and calculating. Her goal through most of both seasons is to dominate Majisuka Gakuen. She often uses people to achieve her goals, such as her only friend Center along with the whole of Yabakune. She has long black hair and wears a typical Majijo uniform. She is always seen sporting a hooded jacket which she keeps her hood up and only puts it down on a few rare instances. Nezumi also wore beige boots, but when they were taken from her she started wearing black ones.`,

	{
		id: 3,
		age: 18,
		fullName: 'Sado',
		image: sado,
		description:
			'Sado had a serious and coolheaded personality, with an aura of strength that could subdue those around her. As demonstrated in her actions towards Maeda Atsuko, she preferred to think things through than immediately begin a fight. She was intimidating to her fellow Rappapa members, and subordinates rarely dared to disobey her orders. Sado was feared and respected by the Majijo students because of her harsh nature in fighting. Oshima Yuko claimed that she was a sadist the first time the two of them fought.',

		fullName: 'Maeda Atsuko',
		image: maeda,
		description:
			'Atsuko wore a standard Majisuka Jyogakuen uniform with a knee-length skirt. Her hair was dark brown and shoulder-length. Like her father, she wore thinly rimmed glasses. Before beginning a fight, she would drop her glasses on the floor. After the fight was finished, she usually put her glasses back on immediately. Atsuko also wore two bracelets on her wrist, one pink and one blue. These bracelets held a deep meaning for her.',

		age: 18,
		fullName: 'Yuko Oshima',
		image: yuko,
		description:
			'Yuko had a fun and relaxed personality, wanting to live life to the fullest despite her illness. She was passionate about fighting, but thought that a person should have a reason to fight or it would be meaningless.',
	},

	{
		id: 6,
		age: 18,
		fullName: 'Black',
		image: black,
		description: `Black's personality was shown to be serious and taciturn. She had a ruthless attitude towards expressing Rappapa's dominance. This was shown when she suggested that the gang do a "cleanup" of the school. These attributes led her to be feared and respected by the students of Majisuka Jyogakuen. However, Black was shown to be also very caring and is shown to care for both her son and her friends.`,
	},
	{
		id: 7,
		age: 18,
		fullName: 'Torigoya',
		image: torigoya,
		description: `Torigoya was an easygoing girl, who acted relatively aloof most of the time. The students of Majisuka Gakuen knew little about how or why she became one of the four Queens. Before the events of the series, only Oshima Yuko had confronted Torigoya in her "awakened" form. In her normal state, Torigoya had little confidence in her ability, and freely admitted that she was "not cut out to be a Queen".`,
	},
	{
		id: 8,
		age: 18,
		fullName: 'Shibuya',
		image: shibuya,
		description: `She was shown to be arrogant and easily provoked. Shibuya preferred to face problems directly rather than to think things through, and was annoyed when something didn't go her way. Her personality traits often conflicted the calm and calculating nature of Sado. Shibuya went behind Sado's back in an attempt to take out Maeda Atsuko. The Rappapa Queen had many followers, including a large gyaru gang.`,
	},
	{
		id: 9,
		age: 15,
		fullName: 'Center',
		image: center,
		description: `Center was in the same year as her ally (and later best friend) Nezumi. Throughout the second season, the two of them attempted to take over Majisuka Jyogakuen. Center was shown to be confident in her strength, and therefore unafraid of any challenge. She also claimed to not care about anything except fighting.`,

	{
		id: 10,
		age: 16,
		fullName: 'Otabe',
		image: otabe,
		description:
			'Otabe was shown to be well mannered and exceptionally intelligent, especially among yankee students. She had a strategic approach to fighting, as she preferred to calculate her chances rather than start battles head on. Her aggressive side was once shown when she slapped Gakuran, who had challenged her authority. However, she kept calm most of the time, and rarely rose to challenges or insults.',
